This folder contains Matlab codes of the Hastie-Stuetzle principal curve algorithm, generating synthetic data sets, and simulations described in Section 5.3.

![image](images/ImmaFontImg_v05.png)

PCA_BC_Ranking_Final.m is the main file of Hastie-Stuetzle principal curve algorithm, which depends on the following Matlab functions:

- PCA_BC_Ranking_Weighted_MultiAtrri.m
- NearestPointOnBCurveDiscreteMethodWeighted.m
- cvxForIntermediateControlPointsWeightedMultiAttri.m.

randomMoreThan2AttributeValues.m and random2dAttributeValues.m are two functions that randomly generate synthetic datasets for main simulations.

1. Run Simulation_vs_CorrelationAndWeights.m to start the simulation v.s. correlations and weights (Fig. 6)
2. Run Simulation_vs_ListLength.m to start the simulation v.s. list length (Fig. 7). 
3. Run Simulation_vs_AttributeNum.m to start the simulation v.s. attribute numbers (Fig. 8). 

Each of the above three simulation files generates Iâ€™mma Sort results as well as the performance measurement, i.e., prediction interval, in .mat format.

rankPredictionInterval.m calculates our main performance metric prediction interval for the generated sorting results.

# Requirements
These Matlab codes can be run in following environment:
- Matlab 2016a or higher version (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), 
- cvx (http://cvxr.com/cvx/) 
-	MOSEK (https://www.mosek.com/).

The details of installing cvx and mosek in Matlab are in http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/mosek.html
